  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is where Melissa's journey as a web developer begins! This page is project for the Amazon Software Develoipment Cohort 4 Front End Developer course that I am taking.</p>
  <p>I've made this site to show off my HTML and CSS Stylesheet skills.
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an experienced member of the Telecommunications Industry with over 15 years of experience. I began as an agent working at a call center for a cable company and progressed to being a supervisor over three teams of dispatchers. I have a lot of troubleshooting experience and know how to manage technician routing assignments an productivity.</p>
  <p>I enjoy teaching and helping others. I've led two mentoring circles for Women in Cable & Telecommunications.</p>
  <h2>Becoming a Web Developer</h2>
  <p>It's been a strange an surreal journey. The first time that I took a Computer Science class in 1998 was my first exposure to HTML and CSS. Taking these classes has been like a trip down memory lane. While it's fun to utilize the skills I've had for years, I am looking forward to more challenging projects so that I can gain new skills.
